* Got rid of `qdo` and `qredo` in favor of making `do` have that
  functionality. So, `do` is now a counted loop with `i`, `j`, `k` references.
* Edited all examples to reflect this change.
* changed the `stdin` catch logic to be better for cross-platform compiles
  in the `revertinput` function.
* expanded the `fractions.dc` example to include multiplication and division
  of fractions.
* adding this file.
* add the `circle.dc` example.
